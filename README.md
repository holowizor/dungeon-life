# dungeon-life
Dungeon crawler rugelike game


TODO
 * hero's life bar (part of hud)
 * monsters' life bars (above each monster)
 * monster movements / different attacks
   * ex. when knight is close - monster rushes at him causing hero to be knocked away (and perhaps also knocked down)
   * monsters move constantly (slower, they speed a bit when they see You)
 * different weapons, weapon switching, inventory
 * fix walls - some should be above the knight (zIndex somehow does not always work)
 * dungeon auto generation
 * much more monster types
 * monster (re-)spawning when You approach 
 * music, sfx
 * screen shakes on hit, red overly when got hit etc.
 * knight development tree (design it)
